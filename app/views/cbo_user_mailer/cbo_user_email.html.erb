<p>Hello Community Partner,</p>

<p>Thank you for participating in the City of Boston's Summer Employment Program.</p>

<p>To login to Summer Jobs Applicant Review Portal, visit the following link: <a href="<%= @url %>"><%= @url %></a></p>

<p>This is a unique link for you and your organization. Do not share it with anyone who should not be reviewing candidate information.</p>

<p>You can begin review applicants now. When you log in, you will see a list of applicants that might have interest in working for you.</p>

<p>We encourage you to reach out to the applicants to schedule interviews. Once you have made your hiring selections, please select "hire" or "do not hire" in the portal.</p>

<p>You must choose your desired candidates by April 30th. This will create an official record of who you want to hire. It will also give you enough time to the complete legal and HR requirements for employing youth.</p>

<p>Please feel free to reach out to our team with any questions or if you notice any issues!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>The BCYF Youth Engagement and Employment Team</p>
